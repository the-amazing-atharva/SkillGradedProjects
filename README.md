# SkillGradedProjects
Project ideas graded by learnt skills

All below are cumulative - the next bullet assumes knowledge of the previous:

+ You have learnt to output something
   + ASCII art, patterns
+ You have learnt to retrieve input from the user
   + Mad libs
   + simple calculation
+ You have learnt conditionals/branching statements
   + 20 questions
   + a very basic text adventure (interactive fiction)
+ You have learnt loops
   + Number guessing game
   + 99 bottles of beer
   + Dice games
   + More patterns - repeat the patterns from early, but this time, use loops and conditionals
+ You have learnt string manipulation
   + Hangman
+ You've learnt arrays (lists, any form of collections)
   + Card games
   + Board games (like "Don't Angry", "Connect Four", "Tic Tac Toe", "Battleships", etc.)
   + [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
   + [Dewdney's Wa-Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor)
   + Sudoku (not the solver, though at this level)
+ You have learnt how to read and write files
   + RPG Character Sheet generator/storage
   + Shopping list
   + Finance tracker
   + Simple data storage (CD collection, etc. - on a basic level)
 ### My additions:
+ You have learnt object-oriented programming:
   + Create a simple game using object-oriented design principles
   + Build a chatbot that can interact with users and respond to their messages
   + Develop a calculator with advanced mathematical functions
+ You have learnt recursion:
   + Implement a recursive algorithm to solve a classic problem like the Tower of Hanoi or the Fibonacci sequence
   + Build a recursive maze generator and solver
   + Develop a recursive fractal generator, like the Sierpinski triangle or the Koch curve
+ You have learnt data structures:
   + Implement a sorting algorithm like bubble sort, insertion sort, or quicksort
   + Build a binary search tree and implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search
   + Develop a priority queue using a heap data structure
+ You have learnt exception handling:
   + Develop a file handling system that can handle different types of exceptions
   + Build a calculator that can handle divide-by-zero and other arithmetic exceptions
   + Create a program that can handle network exceptions like connection timeouts and socket errors
+ You have learnt networking:
   + Build a simple chat application that can send and receive messages over a network
   + Develop a file sharing application that can transfer files between different computers on a network
   + Create a simple web server that can handle HTTP requests and serve static content
+ You have learnt graph algorithms:
   + Implement a graph data structure and perform basic operations like adding and removing vertices and edges
   + Build a program that can perform shortest path calculations using Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm
   + Develop a program that can perform network flow calculations using algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp
